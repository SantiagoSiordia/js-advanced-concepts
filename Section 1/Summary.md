# Section 1

## Javascript engine

Computers only understand ones and zeroes. Javascript is not something they understand.

By having a Javascript engine, you can translate Javascript to ones and zeroes.

There are a lot of [Javascript engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ECMAScript_engines), and they are called ECMAScript engines, well see why later.

Most popular: V8 (written in C++), SpiderMonkey, Chakra.

---

### Who created the first Javascript engine?

Breandan Eich, the creator of Javascript, he created SpiderMonkey, which is what Firefox still uses.

---

This is the process it follows:

It applies a lexical analysis to the **JS File**, which breaks the code into **Tokens**, to identify their meaning, so we know what the code is trying to do. These tokens are formed into an asset we call **Abstract syntax tree (AST)**

To view a visual representation of what this AST looks like, I'll leave this tool called [AST explorer](https://astexplorer.net/), which lets you write some <font color="green">Javascript code </font> and then transform it onto AST or an equivalent <font color="red">JSON</font>.

After interpreting it well have a Bytecode,

But if we want to have optimized code, well need a Profiler and a Compiler too.

---

### Why are they called ECMAScript engines and not JS engines?

ECMAScript was created to tell engine creators how Javascript should work.

---

## Interpreters and compilers

In programming there are two ways of translating to machine language or what our computers understand.

### Interpreter
Translate and read the file line by line on the fly

```JS
function someCalculation(x, y) {
    return x + y;
};

for(let i = 0; i < 1000; i++ ) {
    someCalculation(5, 4);
}
```

### Compiler
Creates a translation before execution.

---
### Babel and Typescript

**Babel** is a Javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and returns browser compatible JS (older JS code).
**Typescript** is a superset of Javascript that compiles down to Javascript.

---

### Why choosing compiler or interpreter?

An interpreter allows you instantly run a file.

A compiler has optimization for code, but it takes a bit more time to run at the beginning.

### Isn't there a way to get best of both worlds?

In late 2000 JIT Compiler was born. It mixes some features of both worlds.

### How to help the javascript engine?

We need know what this next concepts are in order to understand what to do in some rare cases

 - eval()
 - arguments
 - for in
 - with 
 - delete
 - hidden classes
 - inline caching

### Inline caching

```JS
// inline caching

const findUser = (user) => {
    return `Found ${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
};

const userData {
    firstName: 'Santiago',
    lastName: 'Siordia',
};

findUser(userData);
// If we repeat the above line with the same input
// the compiler will return the inline cached value
// 'Found Santiago Siordia'
// this helps optimizing the performance of the code.
```

### Hidden classes

```JS
// This next code makes the compiler deoptimize the code (runs slower)
function Animal(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    // A good option to add new properties would be setting them right here where the constructor sets them.
}

const obj1 = new Animal(1, 2);
const obj2 = new Animal(3, 4);

obj1.a = 30;
obj1.b = 100;

obj1.b = 30; // Assigning new values in no order like this would cause JS to infer this is a different class than what was used before
obj1.a = 100;


```

In the same way, using the `delete` keyword would cause some misperformance.

```JS
delete obj1.x // Hidden clases don't match anymore 
```

We should write code that is predictable. Not only for humnas but for machines as well.

### Call stack and memory heap

Javascript does a lot of things for us, but th ebiggest thing is reading the code and executing it. This

We need a place to store our variables and a place to run and keep track of  whats happening in our code.

That's call stack and memory heap.

We need the **memory heap** as a place to store and write information.

**Memory heap** is where the memory allocation happens

We need a **call stack** to keep track of what place we are in the code, so we can run it in order.
