## Javascript engine

Computers only understand ones and zeroes. Javascript is not something they understand.

By having a Javascript engine, you can translate Javascript to ones and zeroes.

There are a lot of [Javascript engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ECMAScript_engines), and they are called ECMAScript engines, well see why later.

Most popular: V8 (written in C++), SpiderMonkey, Chakra.
