## Execution context
---
[Javascript file to remember](./resources/executionContext.js)

Code in JavaScript is always ran inside a type of **execution context**. Execution context is simply the environment within which your code is ran. There are 2 types of execution context in JavaScript, global or function. There are 2 stages as well to each context, the creation and executing phase. As the JavaScript engine starts to read your code, it creates something called the **Global Execution Context**.

### Global Execution context

- Creation phase
    1. Global object is created
    2. Initializes `this` keyword to global
- Executing phase
    3. Variable Environment created - memory space for `var` variables and `function`s created
    4. Initializes all variables to `undefined` (also known as **hoisting**) and places them with any functions into memory

```JS
this;
window;
this === window;
// Window {...}
// Window {...}
// true
```

### Functional execution context

A `function` context is created by the Javascript engine when it sees a function call. Each function gets its own execution context.

- Creation phase
	1. **Argument object** created with any arguments
	2. Sets `this` to the global object unless in strict mode, where it's undefined.
- Executing phase
	3. **Variable Enviroment** created - memory space for variable and functions created
	4. Initializes all variables to undefined and places them into memory with any new functions.

```JS
function showArgs(arg1, arg2) {
	console.log("arguments: ", arguments);
	return `argument 1 is: ${arg1} and argument 2 is: ${arg2}`;
}

showArgs("Hello", "World!");

// arguments: { 0: "Hello", 1: "World!" }
// argument 1 is Hello and argument 2 is World!

function noArgs() {
	console.log("arguments: ", arguments);
};

noArgs();

// arguments: {}
// even though there are no arguments, the object is still created.

```

```JS
function showArgs(arg1, arg2){
	console.log("arguments: ", arguments);
	console.log(Array.from(arguments));
};

showArgs("Hello", "World!");

// arguments: { 0: "Hello", 1: "World!" }
// [ "Hello", "World!" ]

function showArgs2(...args) {
	console.log("arguments: ", args);
	console.log(Array.from(arguments));
	return `${args[0]} ${args[1]}`
}

showArgs2("Hello", "World!");

// arguments: [ "Hello", "World!" ]
// [ "Hello", "World!" ]
// Hello World!

```

The keyword arguments can be dangerous to use in your code as is. In ES6, a few methods were introduced that can help better use arguments.

### Arrow functions

    Some people think of arrow functions as just being syntactic sugar for a regular function, but arrow functions work a bit differently than a regular function. They are a compact alternative to a regular function, but also without its own bindings to `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new` target keywords. Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and are **NOT** the best option for methods.

```JS

var obj = {
    // does not create a new scope
    i: 10,
    b: () => console.log(this.i, this),
    c: function() {
        console.log(this.i, this);
    }
}

obj.b(); // prints undefined, Window {...} (or the global object)
obj.c(); // prints 10, Object {...}

```

## Hoisting
----

Hoisting is the process of putting **all variable and function** declarations into memory during the **compile phase**. In JavaScript, `function`s are fully hoisted, `var` variables are hoisted and initialized to `undefined`, and `let` and `const` variables are hoisted but not initialized a value. `var` variables are given a **memory allocation** and initialized a value of `undefined` until they are set to a value in line. So if a `var` variable is used in the code before it is initialized, then it will return `undefined`. However, a `function` can be called from anywhere in the code base because it is **fully hoisted**. If `let` and `const` are used before they are declared, then they will throw a reference error because they have not yet been initialized. 

### Takeaways

Avoid hoisting when possible. It can cause memory leaks and hard to catch bugs in your code. Use `let` and `const` as your go to variables.

```JS
 // function expression gets hoisted as undefined
var sing = function() {
 console.log("uhhhh la la la");
}

// function declaration gets fully hoisted
function sing2() {
	console.log("ohhhh la la la");
}
```

```JS

// function declaration gets hoisted
function a() {
	console.log("Hi");
};

// function declaration gets rewritten in memory
function a() {
	console.log("bye");;
};

a();
// bye

```

```JS

// variable declaration gets hoisted as undefined
var favoriteFood = "grapes";

// function expression gets hoisted as undefined
var foodThoughts = function () {
	//new execution context created favoriteFood = undefined
	console.log(`Original favorite food: ${favoriteFood}`);
	
	// variable declaration gets hoisted as undefined
	var favoriteFood = "sushi";
	
	console.log(`New favorite food: ${favoriteFood}`)
};

foodThought();

```

## Lexical environment
---

A lexical environment is basically the scope or environment the engine is currently reading code in. A new lexical environment is created when curly brackets `{}` are used, even nested brackets `{{...}}` create a new lexical environment. The execution context tells the engine which lexical environment it is currently working in and the lexical scope determines the available variables.
 
```JS

function one() {  
	var isValid = true; // local env
	two(); // new execution context
} 
function two() {  
} 

var isValid = false; // global
one(); 

/*
 two() isValid = undefined 
 one() isValid = true 
 global() isValid = false 
 ------------------------ 
 call stack 
*/

```

## Scope Chain
---

![Scope chain](./images/scope-chain.png)

Each environment context that is created has a link outside of its lexical environment called the **scope chain**. The **scope chain** gives us access to variables in the parent environment.

```JS
var x = "x"; 

function findName() { 
 console.log(x); 
 var b = "b"; 
 return printName(); 
} 

function printName() { 
 var c = "c"; 
 return "Brittney Postma"; 
} 

function sayMyName() { 
 var a = "a"; 
 return findName(); 
} 

sayMyName();

// sayMyName runs a = 'a'
// findName runs
// x
// b = 'b'
// printName runs c = 'c'
// Brittney Postma

```

In this example, all the functions have access to the global variable x, but trying to access a variable from another function would return an error. The example below will show how the scope chain links each function.

```JS

function sayMyName() { 
	var a = "a"; 
	console.log(b, c); // returns error
	return function findName() { 
		var b = "b"; 
		console.log(a); // a
		console.log(c); // returns error
		return function printName() { 
			var c = "c"; 
			console.log(a, b); // a, b
		}; 
	}; 
};

sayMyName()()(); //each function is returned and has to be called

```

In this example, you can see that the functions only get access to the variables in their parent container, not a child. The scope chain only links down the call stack, so you  almost have to think of it in reverse. It goes up to the parent, but down the call stack.

![Scope chain call stack](images/scope-chain-callstack.png)

## JS is weird!
---
Variable leakage and reference error calling non-anonymous function expression

```JS

// It asks global scope for height.
// Global scope says: ummm... no but here I just created it for you.
// We call this leakage of global variables.
// Adding 'use strict' to the file prevents this and causes an error.
function weird() { 
 	height = 50; 
} 
var heyhey = function doodle() { 
 	// code here
}; 

heyhey(); 
doodle(); // Error! because it is enclosed in its own scope.

```

## Function and block scope
---
Most programming languages are block scoped, meaning every time you see a new `{}` (curly braces) is a new lexical environment. However, JavaScript is functionally scoped, 
meaning it only creates a new local environment if it sees the keyword function on the 
global scope. To give us access to block scope, in ES6 `let` and `const` were added to the language. Using these can prevent memory leaks, but there is still an argument to be 
made for using `var`.

```JS

//Function Scope

function loop() { 
	for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
		console.log(i); 
	} 
	console.log("final", i); // returns final 5
} 

//Block Scope

function loop2() { 
	for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
		// can access i here
	} 
	console.log("final", i); // returns an error here
} 
loop(); 
/* 
	1 
	2 
	3 
	4 
	final 5 
*/
loop2(); // ReferenceError: i is not defined

```

### `let` and `const`

Variable declarations with `let` and `const` work differently from the `var` variable declaration. When a lexical scope is entered and the execution context is created, the engine allocates memory for any var variable in that scope and initializes it to `undefined`. The `let` and `const` variables only get initialized on the line they are executed on and only get allocated `undefined` if there is no assignment to the variable. Trying to access a `let` or `const` variable before it is declared or outside of its block without returning it will result in a `Reference Error`.

## IIFE - Immediately invoked function expression
---
Immediately Invoked Function Expression or more simply **IIFE** is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. Can also be referred to as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.

```JS
// Grouping Operator () creates a lexical scope

(function() { 
	// statements
})(); 

// Immediately invokes the function with 2nd set of ()
```

### Takeaways
Avoid polluting the global namespace or scope when possible

## this
---
![dun-dun-dun](./images/dun-dun-dun.png)

**`this` is the object that the function is a property of**

There that's simple right? Well, maybe not, what does that mean? Back in Execution Context, we talked about how the JavaScript engine creates the global execution context and initializes `this` to the global window object.

```JS

this; // Window {...}
window; // Window {...}
this === window; // true

function a() { 
	console.log(this); 
} 

a(); 
// Window {...}

```

In the example above, it is easy to understand that `this` is equal to the `window` object, but what about inside of `function a`? Well, what object is `function` a apart of? In the dev tools, if you expand the window object and scroll down the list, you will see `a()` is a method on the `window` object. By calling `a()`, you are essentially saying `window.a()` to the console.

```JS

const obj = { 
	property: `I'm a property of obj.`, 
	method: function() { 
		// this refers to the object obj
		console.log(this.property); 
	} 
}; 

obj.method(); 
// I'm a property of obj.

```

	this refers to whatever is on the left of the . (dot) when calling a method

```JS
// obj is to the left of the dot
obj.method();
```

```JS

function whichName() { 
 	console.log(this.name); 
} 

var name = "window";

const obj1 = { 
	name: "Obj 1", 
	whichName 
}; 

const obj2 = { 
	name: "Obj 2", 
	whichName 
}; 

whichName(); // window
obj1.whichName(); // Obj 1
obj2.whichName(); // Obj 2

```

Another way to look at `this` is to check which object called it.

```JS

const a = function() { 
	console.log("a", this); 
	const b = function() { 
		console.log("b", this); 
		const c = { 
			hi: function() { 
				console.log("c", this); 
			} 
		}; 
		c.hi(); // new obj c called function
	};
	b(); // ran by a window.a(b())
}; 

a(); // called by window

// a Window {…}
// b Window {…}
// c {hi: ƒ}

```


- **new keyword binding** : the new keyword changes the meaning of `this` to be the object that is being created.
- **implicit binding** : `this` refers to the object that is calling it. It is implied, without doing anything it's just how the language works.
- **explicit binding** : using the `bind` keyword to change the meaning of `this`.
- **arrow functions as methods** : `this` is lexically scoped, refers to it's current surroundings and no further. However, if `this` is inside of a method's function, it falls out of scope and belongs to the `window` object. To correct this, you can use a higher order function to return an arrow function that calls `this`

```JS
// new binding
function Person(name, age) { 
	this.name = name; 
	this.age = age; 
	console.log(this); 
} 

const person1 = new Person("person1", 55);

// this = Person { name: 'person1', age: 55 }
//implicit binding
const person = { 
	name: "person", 
	age: 20, 
	hi() { 
		console.log("hi " + this); 
	} 
}; 

person.hi(); 

// this = person { name: 'person', age: 20, hi(){...} }
//explicit binding

let name = "Brittney";

const person3 = { 
	name: "person3", 
	age: 50, 
	hi: function() { 
		console.log("hi " + this.name); 
	}.bind(window)
};

person3.hi(); 
// hi Brittney
// this = window {...}

// arrow functions inside objects
const person4 = { 
	name: "person4", 
	age: 40, 
	hi: function() { 
		var inner = () => { 
			console.log(this); 
		}; 
		return inner(); 
	} 
};  

person4.hi(); 
// this = person4 { name: 'person4', age: 40, hi() {...} }
// if either function is changed around, it doesn't work

```

### Lexical vs Dynamic scope

A big gotcha for a lot of people working with `this` is when a `function` is ran inside of another `function`. It gets a little confusing, but we can remember who called the `function`.

```JS

const obj = { 
	name: "Billy", 
	sing() { 
		console.log("a", this); 
		var anotherFunc = function() { 
			console.log("b", this); 
		}; 
		anotherFunc(); 
	} 
}; 

obj.sing(); 
// a {name: "Billy", sing: ƒ}
// b Window {…}

```

In the example above, the obj called `sing()` and then `anotherFunc()` was called within the `sing()` `function`. In JavaScript, that `function` defaults to the `Window object`. It happens because **everything in JavaScript is lexically scoped** except for the `this` keyword. It doesn't matter where it is written, it matters how it is called. Changing `anotherFunc()` instead to an `arrow function` will fix this problem, as seen below. Arrow functions do not `bind` or set their own context for `this`. If `this` is used in an arrow function, it is taken from the outside. Arrow functions also have no arguments created as `functions` do.

```JS
const obj = { 
	name: "Billy", 
	sing() { 
		console.log("a", this); 
			var anotherFunc = () => { 
			console.log("b", this); 
		}; 
		anotherFunc(); 
	} 
}; 
obj.sing(); 
// a {name: "Billy", sing: ƒ}
// b {name: "Billy", sing: ƒ}
```

Another example to solidify the concept of `this`.

```JS
var b = { 
	name: "jay", 
	say() { 
		console.log(this); 
	} 
};

var c = {
	name: "jay",
	say() {
		return function() {
			console.log(this);
		};
	}
};

var d = {
	name: "jay",
	say() {
		return () => console.log(this);
	}
};

b.say(); // b {name: 'jay', say()...}
// b called the function

c.say(); // function() {console.log(this)}
// returned a function that gets called later

c.say()(); // Window {...}
// c.say() gets the function and the Window runs it

d.say(); // () => console.log(this)
// returned the arrow function

d.say()(); // d {name: 'jay', say()...}
// arrow function does not rebind this and inherits this from parent
```

After everything is said and done, using this can still be a bit confusing. If you aren't sure what it's referencing, just console.log(this) and see where it's pointing.
